\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
from a vector-\/compacted probabilistic tractogram in float precision it also keeps track of the thresholded and log-\/transforms status of the data, implements the necessary conversions and the tractogram dissimilarity measures

from a vector-\/compacted probabilistic tractogram in 8-\/bit (unsigned char) precision it also keeps track of the thresholded status of the data and implements the tractogram dissimilarity measures
